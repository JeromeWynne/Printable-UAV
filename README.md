# printable-UAV
This program was developed by a team of 10 engineering students, of whom I was one, in late 2015. The project's brief was to create a Matlab program that generated a .stl file for each component of a UAV. These .stl files can then be used to print the components on most 3d printers.

This project is something of a mess at the moment in terms of function names, but it does work - to use it download the files and run GUIfinal.m. Note that simply opening the GUIFinal figure from the Matlab explorer won't work, presumably because the program depends on some Java that doesn't run when the fig file is opened.

To provide an idea of what the program does, here are a few screenshots of a near-final version. Hopefully I'll update these soon!
